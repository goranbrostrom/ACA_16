## Introduction

I want to study infant mortality with data from the file *observation*. So I load it, and also the file *person*.

```{r}
load("data/observation.rda")
load("data/person.rda")
```

There are some redundant information in *observation* which we remove:

```{r}
names(observation)
library(dplyr)
obs <- select(observation, idi, birthdate = birth_date, sex, occupation, married, enter, exit, event, m_idi)
summary(obs)
```

There are some glitches here: A quick fix:

```{r}
obs$enter <- pmax(obs$enter, 0)
with(obs, sum(exit - enter <= 0))
```

Good!

The occupation:

```{r}
obs <- filter(obs, occupation > 9999 &
                  occupation < 100000)
obs$occ <- cut(obs$occupation, seq(1:10) * 10000, right = FALSE, labels = 1:9)
with(obs,  table(occ, event))
```
