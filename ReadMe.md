## Introduction

This is material for the course *Intermediate Data Structure and Extraction
Software*, Amsterdam 28- 30 November 2016.

**slides.Rnw** creates the slides, bu note that you need a TeX system on
    your computer to actually build

**slides.pdf**	

**presentation.Rmd** reads the created files *observation.rda* and
    *person.rda* (not included here).

**presentation.html** is the corresponding html file.	

**fromIDS.Rmd** is an *R markdown* file; the corresponding *html* output is 

**fromIDS.html** (included here for convenience). Creates a file for
*statistical analysis from IDS files* 
(INDIVIDUAL and INDIV_INDIV, particularly simple versions). And
documentation *on the fly*. The example topic is *infant mortality*. 
(This is an early attempt that will not be used in the course.)

## General

Install **R** and *RStudio* and run the Rmarkdown file(s). You need data,
which is *not* included here. *RStudio* will guide you in installing the 
necessary add-on packages (if any).

You can choose as output media from *html*, *pdf* and *word*.

## Download

For opening an html document, choose "Download ZIP",
unpack the zip file and open the html document in a web browser. 

Better still, install [git](https://git-scm.com) and *clone* the repository
and *convert to your own project*.
